        <p>Hi my name is Anson Lit I am 24 years old this year. I enjoy running, swimming, and hiking. But what I
            <em>really</em> love enjoy doing is playing ultimate frisbee.
            I have enjoyed the CIT program so far even though I had no prior experience with any sort of computer
            programming.
            Everything has been super interesting so far and I <strong>can't wait</strong> to learn more!
        </p>
