    <h2>A bit about me!</h2>
    <p>Hi my name is Anson Lit I am 24 years old this year.
        I enjoy running, swimming, and hiking. But what I <em>really</em> love enjoy doing is playing ultimate frisbee.
        I have enjoyed the CIT program so far even though I had no prior experience with any sort of computer
        programming.
        Everything has been super interesting so far and I <strong>can't wait</strong> to learn more!
