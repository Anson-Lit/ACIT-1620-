            <p>Hi my name is Anson Lit I am 24 years old this year. I enjoy running, swimming, and hiking. But what I
                <em>really</em> love enjoy doing is playing ultimate frisbee. I have enjoyed the CIT program so far even though I had no prior experience with any sort of computer programming. Everything has been super interesting so far and I <strong>can't
                    wait</strong> to learn more!
